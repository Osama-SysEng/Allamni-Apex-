### Design rules
1. LLM never owns authorization or critical numeric truth.
2. Every important mutation has an event/idempotency key.
3. Adaptive decisions are explainable through evidence.
4. Agent traces are observable and subject-scoped.
5. Integrations fail closed and retry safely.
6. Production providers implement existing interfaces; deterministic provider is explicit development fallback.
